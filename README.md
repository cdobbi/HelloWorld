# Hello World in R - Setup

## Overview
Hello World in R is my first R program. I'll be using it to build a rabbit genome calculator that predicts coat outcomes of 10 offspring based on the pairing of 2 adult rabbits.

This small line of code, prints a message to the terminal confirming that R is installed and working.

## Development Environment
Editor: VS Code
Language: R (version 4.5.2)
    - R is sophisticated calculator for structured data, patterns, and probabilities. It has built-in support for vectors, lists and dataframes without needing extra libraries. This means, i'll be able to model allele combinations, filter genotype outcomes, and run logic-heavy predictions with a few lines of code. R handles looping through genetic pairings cleanly. I can store and query common genotype patterns. It interacts well with cloud databases like Neo4j. I'ts not flashy or overcomplicated, it just speaks genetics.
Extensions:
    - VSCode-R for syntax and termianl support.
    - languageserver installed manually to support code hints.
How I Ran It:
    - I created a file called 'hello_world.R'
    - I typed 'cat("Hello, world!\n")'
    - I pressed 'Ctrl + Enter' and saw the message in the terminal, "Hello, World!"
